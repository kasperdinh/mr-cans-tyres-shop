# Walkthrough - Monorepo Initialization

- Monorepo Init: TurboRepo configured, pnpm workspace enabled
- Files created: package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json
- Frontend (apps/client): Next.js 15, Tailwind, TypeScript initialized
- Backend (apps/server): NestJS standard structure initialized
- Verification: pnpm install & pnpm build successful
- Next steps: Implement Shared DTOs, configure ESLint + Prettier
- Code Quality: packages/config created for shared ESLint/Prettier
- Apps (server, client, shared) updated to use @mr-cans/config/eslint
- Husky pre-commit hook installed, lint-staged configured (prettier --write)
- Verification: turbo run lint passed all packages
- Shared DTOs: packages/shared created with TS + Zod
- Server & Client linked via workspace:\* protocol
- Verification: turbo run build passed; runtime import in server verified
- Next steps: Implement DTOs for Auth and Products
- Env Validation: Zod schema (PORT, DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV) integrated in Server
- Config Module: @nestjs/config + validation function in AppModule
- Verification: Startup fails on invalid env, succeeds on valid env
- Docker Setup: Postgres 16 & Redis 7 via docker-compose
- Persistence: Local volume mapping to `.docker-data`
- Scripts: `pnpm docker:up` and `pnpm docker:down` added
- CI/CD: Actions workflow created (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Pipeline: Lint, Build, Test (via TurboRepo)
- Testing: Fixed app.controller.spec.ts to match shared constant
- Branch Protection: Enforced via GH CLI (Require PR, 1 Review, Linear History, Checks: Lint/Build/Test)
- Refactor: Renamed package scope from `@mr-cans` to `@canstyres`
- Impact: Updated `packages/*`, `apps/*` dependencies, and all source imports.
- Consistency: Docker containers renamed to `canstyres-*`. CI envs blocked.
